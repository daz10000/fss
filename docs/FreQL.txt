F# Records for SQL
=============================

Currently supports only Postgres

Reading from SQL to an F# record

open FSharp.Data.Sql

use db = new DynamicSqlConnection(connString)
let teamClues = db.Query<TeamClue>  "
                SELECT  t.name as team,a.teamid as teamid, clue,d.created as 
                            created,i.id as imageId,d.id as docId,false as dup
                FROM
                            image i     JOIN doc d on i.docid = d.id
                                        JOIN address a on a.id = d.emailid
                                        JOIN team t on t.id = a.teamid
                WHERE
                        clue <> -2 AND d.created <= '2014-02-08 20:32'
                        AND d.created > '2014-01-01'
                ORDER BY
                        a.teamid asc,d.created asc
                " |> Array.ofSeq



Inserting F# records into SQL

Single record:

Assumes SQL record

create table run 
(
    id integer primary key not null,
    name varchar(128) not null,
    address varchar(128) not null
)


// Note record names should be lowercase for postgres
let foo = { id = 6 ; name = "darren" ; address = "123 smith way" }

let insertedIds = conn.InsertOne<Run,int> run

// Assumes primary key is returned as an integer.
// If primary key is a serial type, insert a record that does not contain
// the field that will be generated and the returned stream of types will be
// the primary key.  
// If the primary key is composite, the return type should be unit and will
// not contain the primary key



runRecords |> conn.InsertMany<Run,int> run |> ignore
