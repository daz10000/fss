F# Records for SQL
=============================

Currently supports only Postgres

Reading from SQL to an F# record

open FSharp.Data.Sql

use db = new DynamicSqlConnection(connString)
let teamClues = db.Query<TeamClue>  "
                SELECT  t.name as team,a.teamid as teamid, clue,d.created as 
                            created,i.id as imageId,d.id as docId,false as dup
                FROM
                            image i     JOIN doc d on i.docid = d.id
                                        JOIN address a on a.id = d.emailid
                                        JOIN team t on t.id = a.teamid
                WHERE
                        clue <> -2 AND d.created <= '2014-02-08 20:32'
                        AND d.created > '2014-01-01'
                ORDER BY
                        a.teamid asc,d.created asc
                " |> Array.ofSeq



Inserting F# records into SQL

Single record:

Assumes SQL record

create table run 
(
    id integer primary key not null,
    name varchar(128) not null,
    address varchar(128) not null
)


// Note record names should be lowercase for postgres
let foo = { id = 6 ; name = "darren" ; address = "123 smith way" }

let insertedIds = conn.InsertOne<Run,int> run

// Assumes primary key is returned as an integer.
// If primary key is a serial type, insert a record that does not contain
// the field that will be generated and the returned stream of types will be
// the primary key.  
// If the primary key is composite, the return type should be unit and will
// not contain the primary key



runRecords |> conn.InsertMany<Run,int> run |> ignore

InsertMany takes optional argument ignoredColumns   for columns where the db should supply the value not the incoming record
InsertMany takes optional argument transProvided if the insertion should use an existing transaction rather than creating its own temporary transaction
